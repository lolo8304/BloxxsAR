# BloxxsAR - my first AR game to fight for Bloxxs

since the first appearance of AR with Hololens from Microsoft in 2016 I am a big fan of Augmented Reality. Then came Apple with ARKit and the world of AR is now in almost everybodies hands - at least on iPhone 8 and later :-)

with this Game I am learning
- Unity
- ARKit with Unity
- Game Design

and finally develop a Game that my son wanted to play

first setup June 2019. Right after presentation ARKit 3 beta. But I want to use the standard ARKIt 2.0 features and their Unity packages.

## installation
- Xode 10. +
- Unity Hub
- Unity 2019.1 +
- Unity Packages to be installed: AR Foundation, ARCore Kit Plugin, ARKit XR Plugin with Version previews ? 2.1.0 (and NOT 2.2.0)


### errors if wrong packages installed
you will get link errors at the end of the Unity / XCode code generation and running the app. Dont try to solve it, it is only a library depdency issue due to the fact that 2.2.0 Version already contain ARKit 3



## First steps
I was following some Youtube tutorials 
- Getting Started With ARFoundation in Unity (ARKit, ARCore) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml2UakwRxjk
